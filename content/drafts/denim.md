## A very brief history (#history)

### Japan (#japan)

## Buying denim today (#today)

### Raw (dry) denim (#raw)

> These mean the same thing. The denim was not factory washed, and sometimes not singed which leaves the denim looking "hairy". The dye is generally dark and even, so that you can fade them yourself. The jeans probably contain some amount of starch that will rinse off in the wash and soften over time. This is to keep it rigid so that creases set in and make cool fades.

> Sanforized jeans (most jeans) will not shrink a crazy amount in the wash. They'll lose maybe 1" or 1.5" in the waist and inseam.

### Selvedge (#selvedge)

> This is the edge of denim fabric as produced on a shuttle loom. It is commonly used in the outseam and details of higher end jeans. The outseam may resist fraying, but selvedge itself has no significant impact on denim durability.

> Selvedge used to be a general indicator of quality, but that doesn't mean that all jeans with selvedge are better than jeans without.

### Weight (#weight)

> A 10oz jean is lightweight, and will breathe in the summer. A 21oz jean is heavy, and will not be fun to wear if it gets hot where you live.

### Right-hand versus left-hand twill (#right-left)

### Chainstitching (#chainstitching)

> Different style of stitching used in premium denim's that creates a more obvious roping effect on the hem than the standard lock stitch. It isn't as strong as a lock-stitch, but roping can be desirable for aesthetic value or to emulate early 20th century style production.
